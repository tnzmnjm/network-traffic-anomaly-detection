# Z-score tells how many standard deviations away a given observation is from
# the mean. For example, a Z score of 2.5 means that the data point is 2.5 standard
# deviation far from the mean. And since it is far from the center, itâ€™s flagged as
# an outlier/anomaly. The Z-score measures how far a data point is away from the
# mean as a signed multiple of the standard deviation. Large absolute values of
# the Z-score suggest an anomaly.

#  GMM : A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data
#  points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with
#  unknown parameters.
